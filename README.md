# PySnake
Classic Snake game coded in Python using the Turtle module.
Version 1 achieves smoother movement by reducing object size, step length and delay between moves.
Version 2 aims to achieve smoother movement by reducing only step length and delay. This is the natural method of increasing framerate and work is still in progress.

Features:
Use arrow keys to move the snake and eat food.
Use "p" to pause and unpause the game.

Bugs to fix:
Version 2 - overlapping of body segments.
